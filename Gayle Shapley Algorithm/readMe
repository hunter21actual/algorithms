# Solution to stable marriage problem

Refer to :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem

Statement from wikipedia -

"Given n men and n women, 
where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, 
marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who 
would both rather have each other than their current partners. 
When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is deemed stable"

Note that this algorithm guarantees that:

1. Everyone gets married 
    At the end, there cannot be a man and a woman both unengaged, 
    as he must have proposed to her at some point 
    (since a man will eventually propose to everyone, if necessary) and, being proposed to, 
    she would necessarily be engaged (to someone) thereafter.

2.The marriages are stable 
    Let Alice and Bob both be engaged, but not to each other. 
    Upon completion of the algorithm, 
    it is not possible for both Alice and Bob to prefer each other over their current partners. 
    If Bob prefers Alice to his current partner, he must have proposed to Alice before he proposed to his current partner. 
    If Alice accepted his proposal, yet is not married to him at the end, 
    she must have dumped him for someone she likes more, and therefore doesn't like Bob more than her current partner. 
    If Alice rejected his proposal, she was already with someone she liked more than Bob.
